			<h1>Test John Walter Mackenzie Dudding, architect, 1898 to 1987</h1>
				<h3>More than just a dreamer</h3>
		</center>
<p> I only got to know my great-uncle John in the late 1970s, when I lived 10 minutes’ walk away from John and his wife Jane.  Jane was my grandmother’s oldest sister, and more sophisticated than anyone I had ever met with her twinset and pearls.  In the school holidays I was regularly invited for lunch, after which Jane would not allow me to help her tidy up, telling me I was to “keep John company.”</p>
<p> We watched tennis or cricket on television in the grand living room with paintings all along the walls.  There were large oils of men in black, wearing white stock collars, and smaller coloured Daguerrotype portraits.  When asked about who they depicted, John would mumble something about ancestors.  It all fitted with the upper class style they lived in. </p>
<p> If rain stopped play, John and I would peruse the hundreds of art books which lined the lower walls in the living room, the hallway and the dining room and it was then that I began to see beyond the reticent and unfailingly polite gentleman.  When it came to Turner’s paintings, John got a far-away look in his eyes. </p>
<p> John Mackenzie Dudding was born in 1898<sup><small>1</small></sup> to an English father and a Scottish mother.  His father, John Walter Dudding, was a younger son in a line of gentleman farmers in Lincolnshire.  His mother, Catherine Mackenzie Ross, grew up with eight siblings and her twice-widowed mother in and around Inverness. </p>
<p> So how might John Walter Dudding and Catherine Mackenzie Ross’s paths have crossed, leading to my great-uncle John’s birth in Newark in 1898?  In 1901<sup><small>2</small></sup> and earlier censuses<sup><small>3</small></sup>, John Walter Dudding is listed as a mechanical engineer, but the 1911<sup><small>4</small></sup> entry opens up new possibilities: If John Walter Dudding had been a “travelling representative” for “agricultural engineers and steam boiler makers” for some time, he may have traversed the country for business, including far-flung corners of Scotland, and stayed at Balmoral Lodge near Inverness, which Catherine’s mother had run as a hotel from at least 1891<sup><small>5</small></sup>. </p>
<p> In 1911 John Mackenzie Dudding was still an only child and the family lived at Princess Royal Terrace in Scarborough, a very decorative row of terraced houses with front gardens.  This was the time that John’s mind drifted back to in later years.  As he succumbed to Alzheimer’s in the mid-1980s, he thought he was again in Scarborough at the most care-free time of his life.  Every visitor to his bedside was asked how they liked Scarborough and how long they were staying. </p>
<p> But when he turned 16, things were about to change.  In February 1914 his sister was born in Darlington<sup><small>6</small></sup>.  In July 1914 long-fermented talk of war came to fruition.  And, as I only found out much later, John went to Scotland. </p>
<p> As a teenager I asked John about his work as an architect.  He was not very forthcoming.  On one occasion he took me into the studio he kept at home and showed me drawings of a maisonette-style house which unfortunately looked just like so much other modern architecture to me. </p>
<p> John did like to talk about Turner.  And he liked having the same initials, though not in quite the same order, as Joseph Mallord William Turner.  At the time I did not know that he had decided for himself to add in the “Walter” that his father, grandfather and great-grandfather had all had as a middle name. </p>
<p> It is only 27 years after John’s death that I search for him on the Internet.  I cannot believe my eyes:  A website about modern architecture lists four houses he built in the 1930s<sup><small>7</small></sup>.  There is a photograph of 34 Coneydale<sup><small>8</small></sup> built in 1937, which I find out is “the first ‘modern’ house permitted in Welwyn Garden City”<sup><small>9</small></sup> by the original architect of this new town.  Two houses in Woldingham Garden Village (North Downs) are described as “modern buildings of notable design” in the 2005 Village Design Statement<sup><small>10</small></sup>.  The fourth house is also a flat-roofed private residence, this time in Bovingdon (near Hemel Hempstead).  The website has a contact e-mail address and I immediately write to “ukmodernhousefanatics”.  I tell of my pleasure at finding out about my great-uncle’s work and that “All he really told me was that he had had a lot of good ideas and had had to build a lot of bad buildings.” </p>

	<p> Hugh Martin, one of the contributors to the website, replies:  “John Dudding is an interesting figure, but not necessarily because of his houses.  He's remembered mainly for his work with the Miners' Welfare Commission designing pithead baths and drying rooms.  As a new initiative, these were built in the … modernist style with flat roofs and strip windows … Dudding's entries in Pevsner’s Buildings of England are all pithead baths (at Snibston<sup><small>11</small></sup>, Leicestershire; Clay Cross<sup><small>12</small></sup>, Granville<sup><small>13</small></sup> and Williamthorpe<sup><small>14</small></sup>, Derbyshire; and at Rufford<sup><small>15</small></sup> in Nottinghamshire). Unfortunately, due to pit closures [in the 1990s], many if not all of these buildings have been demolished.”<sup><small>16</small></sup> </p>
	<p> He attaches a scan from an architectural journal<sup><small>17</small></sup> “explaining the background and illustrating some of his work.  It also illustrates two of his houses in the … modernist style.  Health and exposure to light and sunshine were all part of the modernist ethos.” </p>
	<p> I look through the article Hugh Martin sends me and it takes me a moment to find my bearings.  On the third page is a picture of 34 Coneydale, the last page features four photographs of the house at Bovingdon, but what are the front two pages about?  His work for the Miners’ Welfare Commission?  “J W M Dudding … joined the Commission in 1929 and … was architect in charge of the Midlands Regional Office in Nottingham from 1941 until he left the Commission in 1946 when the coal industry was nationalised.”  My “posh” great-uncle worked for the Miners’ Welfare Commission for 17 years?  I am, quite simply, gobsmacked. </p>
	<p> The article includes a letter his wife Jane wrote after his death:  “Pithead Baths were a first.  [In] former days … men arrived, wet with rain, went down the pits and worked, returning home in the same wet clothes.”  The article explains that “The provision of pithead baths was first proposed in an Act of Parliament of 1911 and the Welfare Commission was the result of the Mining Industry Act of 1920, supplemented by another Act in 1926.  This enabled the Commission ‘to Provide Facilities for Taking Baths and Drying Clothes’.” </p>
	<p> It seems that the Miners’ Welfare Commission became a hotbed of young talent interested in modern architecture:  “The Chief Architect of the Miners’ Welfare Commission was John H. Forshaw, whose deputy was C. G. Kemp.  Under them, five architects worked in the Northern Division and five in the Southern.  If a distinct family likeness is evident in the work of the Commission’s architects - reflecting, in particular, the influence of W M Dudok - it was possible owing to these very committed public service architects working together in Hobart House in London from 1922 to 1940.” </p>

	<p> I search some more online and find some of the work that Hugh Martin refers to - my great-uncle John in Pevsner!  The entry in the Dictionary of Scottish Architects<sup><small>18</small></sup> is a revelation:  “John Walter Mackenzie Dudding … was articled to Donald Matheson of Dingwall in 1914.  His training was interrupted by two years' war service but he completed his apprenticeship in 1920.  He then secured a position as assistant in the Board of Agriculture for Scotland in Edinburgh, enabling him to study at Edinburgh College of Art.” </p>
	<p>Dingwall?  That’s near Inverness.  Did his mother send him there, close to her family, but as far away from the war as she could get him?  </p>
	<p> “In 1925 he was admitted to the RIAS [Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland] and moved to London, where he found employment in H M Office of Works and studied at Regent Street Polytechnic.  He left in 1929 and became senior assistant to the Miners' Welfare Commission in 1930, working under John Henry Forshaw and acting as the latter's personal assistant in 1935 and 1936 … In 1936 he was promoted to architect for the Commission, becoming responsible for the Midlands Coal Fields … He was elected FRIBA [Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects] on 12 December 1944 ...” </p>
	<p> Hugh Martin finishes his e-mail:  “I’d like to think that he was proud of his work in the 1930s, and that his “bad buildings" were the post-war work where he was forced to compromise.” </p>
	<p> John’s liking for J M W Turner was rather curiously reflected upon his death when his name was recorded as John William Mackenzie Dudding<sup><small>19</small></sup> - the subversion of Walter into William brought him even closer to Turner.  I like to go to the National Gallery and gaze at the Turners and wonder if he ever stood there, admiring them as I do. </p>
